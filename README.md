# LANLdocs
I realized that there isn't a place where you can download the manuals for Poisson Superfish and Parmela from LANL, unless you download and install them on your Windows computer. This is not very convenient for OSX or Linux users to collaborate with Windows users. So I downloaded them and uploaded them here.

## Tips
